# This file contains regular expressions used as features of particular tokens
# No entity tag is needed as matches of these regular expressions will not
# be added as named entities.
#
# General notes:
#  Commented lines begin with a '#'
#  Regular expressions should be written in boost::regex format for c++
#  Regular expressions are treated as case insensitive
#  Quotation marks should not be included unless they are part of a regular 
#  expression
#  Construction of regular expressions through use of variables is not
#  not permitted in this file.  Since only individual tokens are matched
#  regular expressions are likely to be simpler than those matching multiple
#  tokens
